                <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p> With over ten years of experience in nursing, primarily within a high-risk antepartum unit but also within public health, I'm embarking on a career transition that merges my well-honed clinical skills with the burgeoning field of computer science to drive impactful change in healthcare technology. I'm inspired by the potential of machine learning to reshape healthcareâ€”my goal is to leverage advanced algorithms to streamline physician and caregiver workflows while minimizing medical errors through predictive models and decision-support tools. Furthermore, I am intrigued by the potential of machine learning to positively impact patients directly, particularly in the realm of proactive healthcare. I am interested in exploring how machine learning algorithms can effectively identify high-risk patients by analyzing complex medical data, historical trends, and lifestyle factors. This data-driven approach can lead to early detection and personalized intervention, enabling healthcare providers to offer tailored support and mitigate potential medical complications, thus enhancing the lives of their patients. Ultimately, I am committed to interdisciplinary collaboration and strive to contribute to comprehensive, ethical, and future-oriented solutions that elevate healthcare technology.</p>
